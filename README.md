cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies from the root directory:
```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development

# Razorpay API Keys
